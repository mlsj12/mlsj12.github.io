        <h2>Schematic Explanation:</h2>
        <p>
          For this assignment, I started at the start, by thinking about what I wanted the user to do with the website. I came 
          up with the idea of a room checker, that takes in <b>two</b> sensors, a photoresistor and a thermistor, to give the user 
          a color that corresponds with both the room's temperature and brightness (red/blue for hot and cold, and opacity of 
          yellow for how bright/dim). 
          It will also print some text on the page, at this 
          point, I didn't know what text it would have--a summary of the results, the RGB values, or something in between--but I 
          wanted some kind of text. 
          <br><br>
          I decided on just the RGB values for the color of the screen. 
          <br><br>
          For the website input to the Arduino, I want to include a button that turns on a red LED that notifies the user that
          their "Check Room" is being processed.

    <h2>Calculations:</h2>
    <p style="font-family: Noto Sans Math; font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 0%;">
      Red LED has a 1.8V drop: <br>
      5v - 1.8v = 20mA &times; R --> <b>R = 160Ω+</b>
    </p>
    <p style="display: inline;">
      For the LED, I used a 220Ω resistor. The calculation above is the <b>minimum</b> amount of resistance needed for 
      a red LED to keep the current at 20mA. Since the kit doesn't have a resistor that is exactly 160Ω, I went above the 
      minimum amount to 220Ω. <br>
      As for the two sensors, I created a voltage divider with the sensor and a 10KΩ resistor. I use 10KΩ for both these 
      because these sensors will still do their job with a very limited current and it allows for more of the power for the 
      LED.

        <h2 style="margin-top: 5%;">Circuit Explanation:</h2>
        <p>
          For the circuit, I used my knowledge of LED and voltage dividers to set it up. 
          <br><br>
          I connected the LED to a single 
          digital pin with a resistor before going to ground. 
          <br><br>
          For the voltage dividers, I connected both to 5V to keep them 
          running before adding an analogIn pin <b>after</b> the sensor to actually get what they are sensing.
          I added the 10KΩ resistor to the circuit before ending them also at ground back on the Arduino.

    <h3>Arduino Code</h3>
    <p>
      For the Ardunio code, I had to set up the sensors to get data and print it to the Serial after calibrating the
      photoresistor. Then it sees if there is any data coming from the webserial, if there is the LED will turn on for a second.
      Then it will proccess what reading each sensor is receiving at that point to then send back to the webserial to display 
      the color shade. <br>
      I had some problems with the order of this, putting the LED turning on last, but then it wouldn't turn on, so I changed
      the order and the second the check button was pressed, the LED was on for a second. 
    </p>
<pre><code>
  void setup() {
    // start serial monitor at baud 9600
    Serial.begin(9600);         
    // set up the pin for the LED
    pinMode(5, OUTPUT); 
  }
  
  void loop() {
    // Initialize the max and min variables for the photoresistor calibration using the opposite number
    int light_max = 0;
    int light_min = 1023;  
    // initialize the current sensor value 
    int sensorValue = 0;
    // Calibrate the sensor for five seconds
    while (millis() < 5000) {
      // read the photoresistor value
      sensorValue = analogRead(A1);
      // Record the maximum sensor value
      if (sensorValue > light_max) {
        light_max = sensorValue;
      }
      // Record the minimum sensor value
      if (sensorValue < light_min) {
        light_min = sensorValue;
      }

    // Check if data is available from the serial port
    if (Serial.available() > 0) { 
      int inByte = Serial.read();    // Read incoming data
      Serial.write(inByte); // send it back out as raw binary data
      digitalWrite(5, HIGH);          // Turn on the LED
      delay(1000);
      // turn off LED when the information is sent
      digitalWrite(5, LOW);
    }
    
    // Read the current sensor values after calibration if feedback is received
    int light_value = analogRead(A1);
    // map the photoresistor using the min and max to 0-255 (color hues)
    int mapped_light = map(light_value, light_min, light_max, 0, 255);
    // map the tempature using 0-1023 to 0-255 (color hues)
    int mapped_temp = map(analogRead(A0), 0, 1023, 0, 255);
  
    // Send the mapped sensor values to the Serial monitor
    Serial.print(mapped_temp);
    // enter a comma between the two inputs 
    Serial.print(",");
    Serial.println(mapped_light);
    }
  }

  <h3 style="margin-top: 2%;">A6_index.html Code (Webpage's p5.js code)</h3>
  <p>
    Link to page is <a href="A6/A6_index.html">here.</a><br>
    I've been having issues accessing it through this link, if you can't access it, let me know and I'll try to debug it some more. You may need to connect to the Arduino and use the code snippet above to truely see it working. 
    <br>
    For the JavaScript file, I had some difficulties with as I only took JavaScript back in 9th and 10th grade. From then, I 
    mostly worked in HTML and Python, so I forgot a lot of the commands. However, with my knowledge of coding in general, I 
    was able to sort of work through how to format the code to do what I wanted. As for the changing background color, I tried 
    to explain in the comments what thought process I was going down, but the code still might not be completely accurate with 
    what it is actually doing. 
    <br><br>
    Some of this code was from the examples we had in class, such as the initialization of the buttons. 
    But I edited what actually appears on the website so it is orginal code. <br><br>
    I also used `p5.js`, `p5.min.js`, and `p5.webserial.js` from the p5 library. As we were told in class these are needed
    to connect the Arudino to the website and I didn't change anything here.
