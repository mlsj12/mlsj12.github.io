        <h2>Schematic Explanation:</h2>
        <p>
          Similar to previous assignments, I started by understanding the requirements of the circuit I need to build. I wrote
          out what was needed and then drew out the schematic of each independent circuit. 
          For this assignment, I needed to include a sensor and I chose the photoresistor because it was a sunny day outside! I 
          also used the RGB LED because I initially wanted to use the colors of the rainbow depending on how much light was being
          detected (such as blue for darkness and yellow for brightness). However, as I went through the rest of the requirements,
          I decided not to go down this route. 
          <br><br>
          Since I used three LED and a controlling unit for the lights, I used a common ground, placing each of the negative sides
          into the blue negative connected port on the breadboard, using an additional wire to the ground on the Arduino. This makes
          it easier to see on the Arduino what is connected and also clearer because there are only a few grounding pins.

        <b>The red & green LED both have 1.8V drop:</b><br>
        5V - 1.8V = 20mA &times; R ---> <b>R = 160Ω+</b>

        <b>The blue LED has 3.3V drop:</b><br>
        5V - 3.3V = 20mA &times; R ---> <b>R = 85Ω+</b>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        These resistance calculations show the <b>minimum</b> required resistance to maintain a 20mA current. I don't have 
        specifically those Ohms resistors, so I used higher resistance for each of the LEDs.  For red and green, I used the 
        220Ω resistor and for blue I used a 100Ω resistor. 
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0%">
      <b>Photoresistor circuit:</b> As discussed in class, these controlling circuits will use a 10KΩ resistor because it 
      guarantees a very limited current. If we used a battery to power this entire circuit, we want as much power to the LEDs, 
      giving the most  light rather than powering the controlling unit. The photoresistor will still work as it's supposed to 
      with a higher resistance.

        <h2 style="margin-top: 5%;">Circuit Explanation:</h2>
        <p>
            After thinking about what I wanted to try out with the code, I started building my ciruit. Since I was using the
            RGB LED, I color coded the wires to the color each LED was to the prongs on the single LED. To make sure the LEDs
            were connected correctly, I plugged in the Arduino and tried each of the LEDs to the 5V pin (all the LEDs lit up).
            <br><br>
            As I started coding, I realized I needed to use the map function, something I hadn't used before. I used the 
            Serial.print/println to see how it worked. After understanding how it worked, I decided to not use my original plan
            of fading colors together given what the brightness was. 
            The map function takes the input of the photoresistor which is a brightness number between 0 and 1023 and puts it 
            into a number between 0 and 255, essentially making 255 100% instead of 1023. This number can be used to 
            analogWrite an LED, which uses the number to turn it on and off in relation to each other. 
            <br><br>
            Instead, I used this mapped number to turn on all the LEDs at the same level of brightness the photoresistor picked
            up. I also had a limit of how much brightness could turn on the LEDs. Using the Serial.print, I figured out the 
            brightness was between 153 and 203 out of 255. With this, I decided my limit was 200; if the brightness is less 
            than 200, the LEDs will turn on and adjust their brightness to how much light is surrounding the photoresistor.

    <h2 style="margin-top: 5%;">Additional Questions:</h2>
  <b style="font-size: larger;">1: In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 or does it need to be 
    one or the other? Justify your answer with example calculations.</b>
   <p>
    While the variable resistor can be placed first or second, it is better for it to be at R1. As shown below, treating the
    photoresistor as the first resistor, has more output volts than when it's used as R2. With more output volts, (position R1)
    the longer the photoresistor can run for and give more charge to the LEDs. 
    <br><br>I measured the resistance from the photoresistor and got around 1.56Ω.
    <p style = "font-family: Noto Sans Math; font-size: larger;">
        <b>Photoresistor = R1:</b><br>
        V<sub>out</sub> = 5V &times; <sup>10KΩ</sup>/<sub>10KΩ + 1.56KΩ</sub><br>
        V<sub>out</sub> = 4.325V  (More volts, maintaining the battery longer.)
        <br>
        <b>Photoresistor = R2:</b><br>
        V<sub>out</sub> = 5V &times; <sup>1.56KΩ</sup>/<sub>10KΩ + 1.56KΩ</sub><br>
        V<sub>out</sub> = 0.675V
    </p>
    </p> 
   </p>
 <br>
 <b style="font-size: larger;">2: Draw a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is voltage. Plot the voltage at 
    V-measure of your voltage divider of your shared gif.</b>
    <img src="a3_graph.jpg">
   <p>
    I measured the voltage when there was as much light as possible and as little light as possible. As seen in the photo, I 
    got around 1.61V when there wasn't much light, and less than 1V when there was light. Using this information, I then used
    my video to understand when there was darkness and light. Mapping the light and dark to the 10-sec video, I drew out the 
    voltage for the divider. 
    <br><b>Disclaimer:</b> These numbers may not be completely accurate. I videoed on Saturday morning and measured the voltage on 
    Sunday afternoon due to appointments that interupted working on this homework. I am guessing the difference in light at 
    these times probably changed the voltage reading a little.   
    </p>
<br>
<b style="font-size: larger;">3: AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. Imagine you had 10-bit 
    PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. How would this change your map() code? Explain your answer.</b>
    <p>
        Having a higher bit value for each analogWrite and analogRead means the numbers used are different the PWM (LED fading 
        uses this) would be out of 1023 and the input (photoresistor scale) would be out of 65535. These larger numbers means
        there are more smaller steps of brightness and PWM for the resistor and LED to be at. This would  make the fade of an 
        LED less noticable (smoother transitions of the on/off percentage) due to increased amount of steps; there is 
        less of a change between 0 and 1 out of 1023 and 65535
        than there is from an 8 and 10-bit sequence. The map() code would change since the ranges increases, making each
        of the input and output number scale differently to each other.
