    <h1>Mai Li's Assignment 4!</h1>
    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <p>
        Unlike the past assignments, I didn't linearly go through the steps. In class, we just don't have time to go through
        everything that uses libraries that are in the Arduino kit. I first wrote out the requirements, already having an
        idea of what I wanted to use: the membrane keypad and a single 7-digit display; however I didn't know how or even 
        if it was possible to connect the two. 
        <br>
        Knowing what I wanted, I first took some advice I got in class: <b>understand the two items separately, before putting
        them together</b>. I searched through Youtube to try to find some introduction videos on the keypad and the display.
        I found a man that was really good at explaining the keypad, hooking it to a LCD. I didn't want to hook it
        up to a light crystal display, so I went looking for an explaination on how to set up a 7-digit display as well. I 
        found the same guy talking about this item too and started learning!
        <br>
        <b>Membrane Keypad Video: </b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl1-R6NsejM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl1-R6NsejM</a>

        <br>
        After, I felt a little disappointed because both these items use 7 or 8 pins on the Arduino, but I only have 14 
        digital pins. I wondered if I could use some of the anaglog in pins for the keypad, but I didn't want to try it 
        before some more research into it. I searched for a while, looking at StackExchange and other web forums, such as the 
        <a href="https://forum.arduino.cc/t/membrane-keypad-and-seven-segment-display/652780">Arduino Forum</a>.
        <br>
        This is when I found someone doing exactly what I wanted and I watched him using three of the analog pins for the display.
        I didn't like the entire video and I used a combination of the resources linked above to create this circuit. I also tried
        reversing the pins; the keypad has the three extra analog input pins. I did this because the keypad is the input for the 
        circuit, so I thought it would make more sense that they could use the analog-in pins. However, changing the code and 
        the pins didn't light up the display or even print in the serial monitor, so I went back to the display using the 
        analog pins.

        <h2>Circuit Explanation:</h2>
        <p>
          After looking at videos and resources, I wanted to draw the schematic first, but I didn't know how it would look
          when I was done with, so I came back to the drawing afterwards. I wanted to see the whole circuit laid out on
          the breadboard and visualize what information I had in real life and play with the circuit. 
          <br><br>
          Still wanting to figure out the two items seperately, I first attempted the keyboard and had it print to the serial
          monitor, following the video above for the item. Before I followed the video exactly, I did some digging into why 
          there was no resistors in the video. I found out that some people had used 
          resistors on all 8 of the rows and columns but it wasn't working. Someone else had said that they only needed 
          resistors on either all rows or all columns but not both. This made sense because how the video explained the keypad
          working the rows and columns become one circuit and two resistors may be too much resistance. Then I also saw that 
          others were saying no resistors were needed because the keypad had its own pull-up resistors. 
          So I followed the video and attached the rows and columns to pins 2-9 without resistance. 
          <br><br>
          For the digit display, I also wanted to see it work by itself, but as I watched the video putting the keypad and this
          together, the code and the placement of wires is different. I decided to follow the video. Four of the digits are 
          connected to pins 10 - 13 and the other three (I opted out of using the decimal point), are attached to analog in.
        </p>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Resistance Use</h2>
    <div class="header">
        <p>
            As I mentioned above, I didn't use any resistance for the keypad because I got conflicting messages and what I 
            should do. In the end, I decided to follow the video that was more helpful and I could actually see what happened
            with the circuit without resistance. The other resources I looked at didn't have videos for me to visually understand what was 
            happening with the different ways of adding resistance. 
            <br>
            For the display, I first added a 10KΩ resistor before the ground because I thought it was the same as the button 
            or the photoresistor. I wasn't sure exactly what the resistance would do in this circuit. I went through this, coding,
            and trying it out, but realized that the brightness of the display was very low even if I manually set it to a higher
            brightness level. I then thought, maybe the resistor is doing something to inhibit the lights in the display, 
            and I traded it out for a 1KΩ. This 
            fixed the dim digits and I retook the video and started on the schematic. 
        </p>

    <h2>Gif and Code Explanation:</h2>
    <p>
        Since I didn't know how these items worked, I also didn't know the functions they have either, which is why I also
        followed the videos to come up with the code used. I didn't write all of it myself, but I did change parts of it
        when it wouldn't work since I was using the 7-digit display with the keypad. 
        <br>
        I also treated as learning exercise, adding comments when I wasn't sure what it would do and then going back to change 
        the comment when I figured out what it was.

          <h2>Schematic Explanation:</h2>
          <p>
            As mentioned before, I did not do this linearly and drew the schematic after everything to make sure I understood
            the connections and figured out the two items, and libraries associated with them, out. My schematic shows the 
            4x4 membrane keypad drawn out as switches in an array pattern. As a button is pressed, a single switch at the 
            junction of the row and column is turned on. This is information is then sent to the Arduino to be coded into 
            which button was just pressed. Since I had written out the buttons in an array in the code above, the button is kept 
            as a variable to be used with the display.  
            <br><br>
            Next the single 7-digit display is connected to 7 different pins that can turn on each individual line in a 
            figure-8. The library houses which line(s) should be turned on to create the desired number/letter output. So once
            the key pressed is saved, if that key button is in the array, it will be turned into an integer to be displayed. I 
            think the changing it from a character to an integer is why the letters, pound, and asterisk aren't working. 
            Whenever I clicked them, only the center line would illuminate which is why I didn't include it in the gif.  I 
            didn't have enough time to figure out the exact reason why and fix it before the assignment was due.
            * When I have more time, I will try to figure it out and update this site!

    <h2 style="margin-top: 5%;">Additional Questions:</h2>
  <b style="font-size: larger;">1: Say you are using a servo motor you attach to pin 9. Draw a graph with the X axis in 
    seconds, for two seconds, and the y-axis the voltage at pin 9 with respect to ground. In your loop() you have the following 
    code:</b> 
    <pre style="margin: 0%;"><code>
    for (int i=0, i<180, i++) {
        servo.write(i); 
        delay(100);
    } 
    </code></pre>
    <img src="a4_graph.png">
    <p>
      I tired to logic my way through this question, but I didn't quite understand, in the time frame, how 5V and 0V jumped
      up and down. Instead, I used my multi-meter to measure between pin 9 and ground in the circuit. I first tried to build
      it just to see if visualizing what the servo would do with the code, but it didn't help me understand it completely. <br>
      What I saw on the multi-meter was that in the first 2 seconds of the loop, the volts never reached above 1V but didn't 
      decrease either. I don't think it was as linear as my graph, but 2 seconds is really quick and I couldn't totally 
      diecipher what amount of volts were occuring in the time frame. The graph is my best estimate. 
    </p>
 <br>
 <b style="font-size: larger;">2: Your input device is slightly broken, leading it to give us an erroneous reading 1% of the 
    time. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</b>
    <p>
        The membrane keypad handles these errors differently than other kinds of sensors. It can read a button press when
        there isn't one hit or it can not detect a press when there is a button pressed. To be accurate, the best way would
        be to get multiple comfirmations that a button was pressed before continuing.
<pre><code>
    wait_time = 50ms
    WHILE true (arbitrary time frame)
        IF button1 == PRESSED 
            button_state = True 
            PAUSE wait_time
            IF button2 == PRESSED (still)
              IF button2 == button 1
                button_state = True 
                CONTINUE with button pressed action
</code></pre>
    </p>
<br>
<b style="font-size: larger;">3: Your input device is slightly noisy, leading the measurement to randomly deviate from the 
    true measurement up or down by 10%. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</b>
    <p>
      Again, the membrane keypad doesn't generally have a bunch of noise, but can be faulty due to wiring. So waiting longer
      periods of time to see if the button is still pressed may help calibrate the keypad before use. As well as adding 
      amount of times it must be successful before it proceeds. 
<pre><code>
    wait_time = 75ms
    WHILE true (arbitrary time frame - maybe five times success is achieved in a row)
        IF button1 == PRESSED 
          button_state = True 
          PAUSE wait_time
          IF button2 == PRESSED (still)
            IF button1 == button2
              key_state = True 
          ELSE 
            key_state = False
        IF key_state = True
          success = +1
          RETURN to WHILE loop
        ELSE
          END (restart) 
        IF success = 5
            CONTINUE to program
