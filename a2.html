        <h2>Schematic Explanation:</h2>
        <p>
          Similar to Assignment 1, I began by documenting the project's requirements and initial work before sketching the 
          circuit schematic. This time, I used an RGB LED with four prongs—one for each color and a common ground I did this 
          because I thought it would be cool to incorporate the rainbow to better see the LEDs fade from one to the next. 
          This time I had initially draw each circuit the same way with the resistor first and then the button/LED. This makes
          more sense to me as the restriction happens before the action (even if it happens no matter where it is placed). 
          Initially, I placed the resistor before the button/LED, thinking it made more sense to restrict current before the 
          action. However, on the breadboard, the button didn't control the LED. Switching the resistor to follow the button 
          and pin 2 connection resolved the issue.

        <p>
          After creating my schematic of each independent circuit it was time to actually create it on the board. Before I did
          so, I also wrote out what I wanted to try to code: when the push button is pressed, the light will fade the rainbow.
          I followed my first schematic of having the resistor before the button while doing the same for the LEDs as that had
          been working so far. However, after I started coding the button and LEDs to communicate, it didn't work. The LED 
          wouldn't detect when the button was pressed. <br>
          Before I debugged this issue, I played around with what I wanted to happen when it was pressed, using LOW as the 
          conditional to see if the code worked before messing with the button. I wanted to fade the rainbow when the button
          was pressed but I wasn't entirely sure how to do that because I only have the three primary colors; I didn't know
          how I was going to make all the colors. 
        </p>
        <h2>Debugging</h2>
        <p>
          Since I knew the button had worked before in class doing a simpler version of this assignment; I knew my circuits 
          were the issue. I tried a couple times following the wires for all the LEDs and the circuit but this didn't work. I
          then remembered that I had taken a photo of the circuit I created in class where my button did work. I went back to
          the photo and that was where I learned the resistor was <i>after</i> the button. I tried this and my == HIGH worked.
          I then researched this and learned that since the resistor is acting as a pull-up/pull-down, it has to go after
          so that the status reads correctly or the current may float between numbers instead of being exact.

    <h2 style="margin-top: 5%;">Coding the Rainbow!</h2>
    <p  style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
      I figured out how to make the rainbow fade in a way that makes it look more "rainbow-y." It took a little 
      math and knowing how coding languages work. I had the idea that the color from before had to be part of the next color's
      fade to look correctly. I first didn't have any of the colors turn off, so it was ending by fading into white (all the
      colors turned on). I then realized I needed to turn them off, but I turned them off abruptly half way through the next
      color's fade. <br>
      To accurately fade, the last color needs to fade out. Knowing how programming languages work, I took the variable <i>i</i>  
      and subtracted it against 255 (the highest a color can fade to) to reverse the last color at the same time as the new color
      grows more stronger.

  <b style="font-size: larger;">1: Draw a chart where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage. Draw 3 lines representing 
    the voltage across an LED with analogWrite(led, 64), analogWrite(led, 128), and analogWrite(led,255).</b>
    <img src="A2_Graph.jpg">
    <p>
      I couldn't figure out exactly how to show this as a graph in terms of my circuit so I used my graph to show each of
      the analogWrite in terms of the time it is delayed for the red LED. I'm not sure if I am thinking about it correctly, 
      but my understanding is that with a call of analogWrite(LED pin, 64) the LED will be on for 25% of the time it is 
      delayed (6.25ms) and off for the remaining time. This time is too short for human eyes to see, so it looks like the 
      LED is fading in and out due to the quick changes in on and off. 
    </p>
  <br>
  <b style="font-size: larger;">2: Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws current is 
    your LEDs, how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?</b>
    <p>
      For my circuit, there are a few things happening that are needed to calculate how long it could run on a 1200mAh battery. 
      The first is if the button is clicked, there is a fade of each color either in or out and when it is not clicked, each
      of the red, blue, green LED is blinking every half a second. Addtionally, there is a resistor limiting the current to 20mA
      or less. <br>
      When the button is pressed, there is usually two LEDs on at once, either fading in or out. Because of this, I am going to
      assume there is all power for a single LED to make it easier to calcuate the current (taking the same numbers of milliampere
      as calcuated below). 
      <br><br>When the ciruit blinks each light is fully on for that half a second and then off again, meaning when the blinking 
      happens the current is also at it's highest point for each of the lights. With the 220Ω resistor for red and green LED, they 
      are using <b style="font-family: Noto Sans Math; font-size: larger;">5V - 1.8V = 220Ω &times; A ---> A = 0.01454 
        ---> 14.54mA.</b>
        With the 100Ω resistor for the blue LED, it is using <b style="font-family: Noto Sans Math; 
        font-size: larger;">5V - 3.3V = 100Ω &times; A ---> A = 0.017 ---> 17mA.</b>
        <br><br>To find the length of time this circut can run on a 1200mAh battery, I am going to take the assumption that 
        the fade and the blink will happen each half the time. With this, I only need to divide milliampere per hour by 
        milliamperes of current. <b style="font-family: Noto Sans Math; font-size: larger;"> Runtime = 1200mAh / ((17mA + 14.54mA)/2) = 76h.</b>
        I averaged the two currents for red, green, and blue to make it easier to calcuate. So 76 hours is an estimate of the 
        actual runtime on a 1200mAh battery with fading and blinking happening each 50% of the time.
