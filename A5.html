    <h1>Mai Li's Assignment 5!</h1>
    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <p>
        For A5, I tried very hard to do this as linearly as possible like in A1-A3; however, it was similar to A4 instead. I 
        didn't know exactly what I was doing as we were warned in class that now we could really bust our Arduinos if we had 
        stray wires or misconnections. Not wanting to mess up, I looked up more videos on transistors. <br>

        <br>
        After learning more and understand that the transistor is powered by a small current, from the Arduino, which then controls
        a bigger current, from the power supply, I had more of an idea of what I could create. I already had some ideas, but I 
        settled on controlling the motor and fan with a remote. My brother has many, many, many fans, all of which have a power
        button and 3 speed settings. 
        I used two circuits we have done in class: using the remote control and then using a MOSFET transistor with an LED 
        light strip.

    <br>
    <p>
        With these in mind, I was thinking I could just swap the LED strip with the motor and change the button code for the 
        remote to be associated with different fan speeds. But before I went ahead, I did make sure with my professors so I 
        didn't accidently blow something up and they agreed it worked!

        <h2>Schematic Explanation:</h2>
        <p>
          After getting confirmation I was thinking about this correctly, I drew out my schematic from the circuit I had 
          developed on the breadboard (I had some debugging to do and added a flyback diode to my circuit which is now also
          shown in the schematic). Some of my questions were about the amount of resistance needed in this circuit. I got 
          back that motors generally don't need resistance and since the professor okayed my circuit photo, I went ahead. 
          <br><br>
          I didn't have all the right symbols to draw this so I looked up how an IRemote receiver looked like in a schematic 
          drawing and I got a couple different answers. I tried to find the exactly one we were using in class, but most I 
          found where ones that didn't have a board like ours. 
          <br><br>
          With some more digging, I found one that was similar; I couldn't find a serial number on the one I have
          to match the receiver module
          to a datasheet. The datasheet is 
          <a href="https://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/download/1221272/ETC2/KY-022.html">here.</a> You may have to 
          download it to view it; however, I took the colored Pinout photo as the schematic and drew it similar to how it looks
          in the photo.

    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Resistance Use</h2>
    <div class="header">
        <p>
            As I said above, I didn't use any resistance for either part of the circuit. I was following the IRemote demo
            we had in class and I only put a resistor on the LED light we were trying to turn on and off. While following the 
            LED light strip circuit with the MOSFET, there was also no resistor in that either. 
            <br><br> 
            As part of my video watching for more information, I did note that many had used resistors, but didn't explain how
            they chose them, and I was worried if I picked the wrong one I would blow up my Arduino. 
            Instead, before I connected the circuit to power, I reached out to the teaching team to ask those questions. I got
            back the response I said above, usually there is no resistor for a motor and they proceeded to check my circuit as 
            good without resistance and I proceeded.

            <h2>Circuit:</h2>
            <p>
                The circuit is a little more complex with wires because the sires soldered to my motor fell off and I didn't 
                have time to go somewhere to resolder them. Instead I used alligator clips and additional wire connectors.

          <h2 style="margin-top: 5%;">Code Explanation:</h2>
          <p>
            I tested my motor, connected to only ground and it worked fine in both directions; however using the code to change
            the motor speeds and on/off, the fan was very, very slow to start. For Speed 1 it didn't really move, but it would 
            output the correct comment and make clicking sound of the speed? For Speed 2 it would do a small burst every couple
            seconds with faster clicks and the right comment. For Speed 3, it would go fast for a bit and then stop and then go 
            fast for a bit again, also with the comment correct. And for power, it would turn off correctly.

<h2>A Complete Switch!</h2>
      <p>
        After spending a lot more time on this circuit, I still couldn't figure out why the circuit wasn't working how I wanted.
        Either the motor never turned on or it made sounds but no motion was seen. I tried really hard to debug the code, the 
        circuit, and the logic I was using to try to piece together everything. In the end, I decided that I had to get this 
        assignment in, even if that meant not doing my original plan of making a speed controlled fan for my brother.

    replaced the motor." style="width: 50%;"/>
    <div class="text">
      <h2>Schematic!</h2>
      <p>
        I didn't cut all losses and decided to take just the LED strip that worked in class and somewhat control it like the 
        motor. So in my ACTUAL schematic, I only replaced the motor with the LED strip and got rid of the flyback diode as we
        didn't use one in class.
      </p>
      <h2>Calculations!</h2>
      <p>
        With this new circuit, there is 5V going into the remote receiver and 12 into the LED strip. 
        <br>
        For the receiver, the current should be low below 20mA as it doesn't need a lot to run; however, I didn't use any 
        resistors as we didn't in class for this and when I asked if my motor circuit was okay, the use of resistance was 
        explained. Researching this, I learned that the receiver has resistance inside it, limiting to a current between 20 
        and 10 mA. 
        <br>
        As for the LED strip, it doesn't say how many LEDs there are, but a rough estimate would be around 295 LEDs. I got this 
        because the strip is 16.4 feet and around every 2 inches there are three LEDs. So I divided the inches by two and then 
        multiplied by three to get 295. Since these are white LEDs, each run at 20mA, which gives a current of 5.9mA taken 
        by all of the LEDs in the strip.

      <p>
        I decided to switch because I needed to get this assignment done and I was tired of trying to debug the same issue
        with no luck. So instead, as I said above, I switched to an LED strip to control how dim or bright it is.
