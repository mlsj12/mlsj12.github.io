   <h3 style="color: #816cae">Concept</h3>
   <p>
    For my final project, I designed a self-watering plant system that ensures plants receive the right amount of water over an extended period, especially when the owner is away, such as on vacation or a business trip.
    <br><br>
    This system will use a water pump, water sensor, and an Arduino to monitor and automate watering. When the soil moisture drops below a certain threshold, the system will activate the pump to deliver water from a reservoir directly to the plant.
    <br><br>
    The product combines technology and sustainability to give users a better way to take care of their plants by only needing to fill up the water reservoir when it it low.

            My schematic was the last thing I did before writing up my final project because I didn't know what it would turn 
            out to be with what I wanted it to do. However, now that I used the pump instead of a spray bottle, my circuit is 
            pretty simple. It uses a water pump (motor symbol) and a water sensor to feed an attached plant water when the level is too low. <br><br>
            The power coming from the wall is controlled by the MOSFET transistor that is being powered by the Ardunio like the sensor. With little power, it can turn on and off the pump's power of 12v.

  <h3 style="margin-top: 2%; color: #816cae">Technical Implementation</h3>
  <p>
    For my JetSetPump system, I have designed an automated self-watering plant system that monitors and maintains soil 
    moisture levels.
    <br><br>
    The input device in my system is a <b>water sensor</b>, which continuously measures the amount of moisture that is in the 
    soil. When the sensor detects that the water level has dropped below a predefined threshold, it sends a signal to the 
    Ardunio, triggering the output device, a <b>water pump</b> that is connected to a reservoir and the potted plant.
    <br><br>
    My code ensures the pump waters the plant until the soil moisture reaches enough water mositure for the plant. From 
    previous testing of the pump, I determined the pump moves between 275 (completely submerged in water) and 300-ish (as dry 
    as possible). In this 25 step difference, I preset the pump activation at 80% dryness (292). This makes sure the plant receives 
    adequate hydration without the risk of overwatering.
  </p>
  <h4 style="margin-top: 2%; margin-bottom: 0%; color: #816cae">Disclaimer</h4>
  <p>
    My proposal was to use a spray bottle water the plant and then the contingency if I couldn't make it work would be an 
    LED/sound alert for users to water their plants. However, I really wanted to stick with the addition of self-watering 
    plants as it can be used when owners are away. In the last class before presentations, my TA Danli suggested a pump that 
    would allow me to keep the water factor in my project. <br>
    Even though this isn't using what I had proposed or the contingency plan, the system,
    although changed, still does what I initially set out to do.

    After I got the input and outputs sorted and the system was working each time, I started on the physical aspect of the 
    system. While not pretty, I made a stand and compartments for the Ardunio and "inners" to hide all that clutters the 
    system visually. 
    <br><br>
    I started with the pump, it's very heavy on one side as it's a motor essentially. Despite the weight, I wanted it to be 
    directly above the cleaned out All Purpose Cleaner bottle I used. So I started with stabilizing the bottle to hold the extra weight
    on the top. 
    <br>
    I soon realized I also needed support for the pump itself and added a platform coming out of the bottle's neck and 
    supports downward as the cardboard wouldn't hold the entire pump. While the motor

  <p style="margin-top: 0">
    was supported here, I decided to make a stand for the motor that is rounded, so it sits nicely on top and is easy to put 
    back after refilling the water reservoir. 
    <br><br>
    Lastly, I put a cover over the stand and put the Ardunio and other wires inside behind the bottle to tidy everything up. 
    <br><br>
    * Unfortunately I didn't take any photos while I made the physical appearance, so there is no step-by-step for this part.
