   <p>
    For my final project, I designed a self-watering plant system that ensures plants receive the right amount of water over an extended period, especially when the owner is away, such as on vacation or a business trip.
    <br><br>
    This system will use a water pump, water sensor, and an Arduino to monitor and automate watering. When the soil moisture drops below a certain threshold, the system will activate the pump to deliver water from a reservoir directly to the plant.
    <br><br>
    The product combines technology and sustainability to give users a better way to take care of their plants by only needing to fill up the water reservoir when it it low.

        My schematic was the last thing I did before writing up my final project because I didn't know what it would turn 
        out to be with what I wanted it to do. However, now that I used the pump instead of a spray bottle, my circuit is 
        pretty simple. It uses a water pump (motor symbol) and a water sensor to feed an attached plant water when the level is too low. <br><br>
        The power coming from the wall is controlled by the MOSFET transistor that is being powered by the Arduino like the sensor. With little power, it can turn on and off the pump's power of 12v.

  <p style="font-size: 12px;">
    My <a href="finalprojectproposal.html">proposal</a> was to use a spray bottle water the plant and a contingency (if I couldn't get the spray mechanism to work 
    correctly in the time frame) of a 
    LED/sound alert for users to water their plants manually. However, <b>I really wanted to stick with the addition of self-watering 
    plants as it can be used when owners are away.</b> In the last class before presentations, my TA Danli suggested a pump that 
    would allow me to keep the water factor in my project. <br>
    <i><b>Even though this isn't using what I had proposed or the contingency plan, the system,
    although changed, still does what I initially set out to do.</b></i>

      <p>
        For my JetSetPump system, I have designed an automated self-watering plant system that monitors and maintains soil 
        moisture levels.
        <br><br>
        The input device in my system is a <b>water sensor</b>, which continuously measures the amount of moisture that is in the 
        soil. When the sensor detects that the water level has dropped below a predefined threshold, it sends a signal to the 
        Arduino, triggering the output device, a <b>water pump</b> that is connected to a reservoir and the potted plant.
        <br><br>
        My code ensures the pump waters the plant until the soil moisture reaches enough water moisture for the plant.

  <p>
    From previous testing of the pump, I determined the pump moves between 275 
    (completely submerged in water) and 300-ish (as dry as possible). In this 25 step difference, I preset the pump 
    activation at 80% dryness (292). This makes sure the plant receives 
    adequate hydration without the risk of overwatering.
  </p>
  <h4 style="margin-top: 2%; margin-bottom: 0%; color: #816cae">Code Snippet</h4>
  <div class="header">
  <pre style="margin: 0;"><code style="margin: 0;"> 
// variable for the sensor and pump
int sensorpin = 7;
int mostfet = 6;

// variable for the sensor output
int value = 0;

void setup() {
  // start serial monitor
  Serial.begin(9600);
  // initialize the sensor pin
  pinMode(sensorpin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(mostfet, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // start the sensor
  digitalWrite(sensorpin, HIGH);

  // write water level to serial
  value = analogRead(A0);
  Serial.print("Water Value: ");
  Serial.println(value);

  // stop the sensor
  digitalWrite(sensorpin, LOW);
  </code></pre>

<pre style="margin: 0;"><code style="margin: 0;"> 
  // fully submerged = ~275 | as dry as can be = ~ 300
  // if plant is 70% dry, give it some water
  if (value > 292) {
    // rotate pump for a second
    digitalWrite(mostfet, HIGH);
    delay(1000);
    // turn off pump
    digitalWrite(mostfet, LOW);
  }

  // check plant water level again
  if (value > 292) {
    // rotate pump for a second
    digitalWrite(mostfet, HIGH);
    delay(1000);
    // turn off pump
    digitalWrite(mostfet, LOW);

    delay(2000);

<h4 style="margin-top: 2%; margin-bottom: 0%; color: #816cae">Snippet of Serial Monitor</h4>
<p style="font-family: Courier New">
  Water Value: 393<br>
  Water Value: 302<br>
  Water Value: 269<br>
  Water Value: 263<br>
  Water Value: 260<br>
  Water Value: 250<br><br>
</p>
<p>
  At first the sensor gets a high value, indicating that the plant's soil is dry. The pump is triggered and then it rechecks
  seeing that the value goes down. This snippet is a snapshot of the Serial Monitor and the sensor isn't as exact; sometimes 
  it will read a 405 then 328 and then 286. Since I didn't calibrate it (I tested with the sensor submerged in water and then 
  completely dry) this readings are not surprising.

<h3 style="margin-top: 2%; color: #816cae">Physical Implementation</h3>
   <div class="header" style="margin-bottom: 0">

        After I got the input and outputs sorted and the system was working each time, I started on the physical aspect of the 
        system. While not pretty, I made a stand and compartments for the Arduino and "inners" to hide all that clutters the 
        system visually. 
        <br><br>
        I started with the pump, it's very heavy on one side as it's a motor essentially. Despite the weight, I wanted it to be 
        directly above the cleaned out All Purpose Cleaner bottle I used. So I started with stabilizing the bottle to hold the extra weight
        on the top.
        <br><br>
        I soon realized I also needed support for the pump itself and added a

  <p style="margin-top: 0;">
  platform coming out of the bottle's neck and 
    supports downward as the cardboard wouldn't hold the entire pump.
    While the motor was supported here, I decided to make a stand for the motor that is rounded, so it sits nicely on top and is easy to put back after refilling the water reservoir. 
    <br><br>
    Lastly, I put a cover over the stand and put the Arduino and other wires inside behind the bottle to tidy everything up. 
    <br><br>
    * Unfortunately I didn't take any photos while I made the physical appearance, so there is no step-by-step for this part.
