      <h2>Schematic Explanation:</h2>
      <p>
        To begin this assignment, I documented the project's requirements and initial work. I then sketched the circuit 
        schematics for the three LEDs. Initially, I was confused about connecting each LED to the 5V pin on the controller, 
        which complicated resistor placement. However, I realized that each circuit connects to a separate pin that also 
        supplies power, making the schematic easier to draw and understand. Since I used red LEDs with a 1.8V drop, each 
        circuit required the same resistor value.
      </p>
      <h2>Resistance Calculations:</h2>
      <p style="font-family: Noto Sans Math; font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 0%;">
        5v - 1.8v = 20mA &times; R<br>
        3.2v = 20mA &times; R<br>
        R = 3.2v / 20mA</br>
        R = 3.2v / 0.02m</br>
        <b>R = 160Ω</b>
      </p
      <p style="display: inline;">
        In the final circuit design, I selected a 220Ω resistor. According to the calculation, the circuit requires a minimum 
        resistance of 160Ω to ensure a current of 20mA. Using a resistor with a slightly higher value than the minimum provides 
        more protection of keeping the current lower than 20mA while the circuit still performs effectively.

      <h2 style="margin-top: 5%;">Circuit Explanation:</h2>
      <p>
        The next step I took was to bring my schematic to life! Since the confusion happened while drawing I didn't come across 
        too many issues in this stage. I added the red wires to different pins on the Arduino that I was going to code and 
        connected them to a single line on the breadboard. I then added each of the resistors to that same row to continue 
        a single circuit. I started a new row of connections for each LED to touch the resistor and the next row over. This is 
        the row that is connected to a black wire and goes to a ground pin back into the Arduino.

      <h2 style="margin-top: 5%;">Playing Around!</h2>
      <p>
        Before I started coding, I attached the Arduino to my computer and changed each of the circuit starting points to the 
        5V to make sure my circuits were indeed working, which they were. To get familiar with the system, I started tinkering 
        with what we did in class, making the lights turn on and off. I made them blink SOS and created a wave effect between
        the different LEDs. However, I did not include this as my final for A1: Blink! because I used ChatGPT to figure out
        how to do exactly what I wanted to do. This was fun, but I didn't really understand anything in the actual code 
        that made it work in the way I wanted. <br><br>
        Instead, I did a more complex version of what we did in class for this assignment. LED1 blinks at 100ms, LED2 blinks
        at 500ms, and LED3 blinks at 1000ms or every one second. For this, I coded everything myself and I understand how it
        works. Each pin is coded independently with if it will be given power or no power and for how long using ``delay``.

  <h2 style="margin-top: 5%;">Additional Questions:</h2>
  <b style="font-size: larger;">1: Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a 
    line for each of your 3 LEDs.</b>
    <img src="A1_graph.jpg">
    <p>A1: Blink Graph showing the voltage changes through time as the program continues. For the first LED (red), it 
      turns on and off pretty frequently as shown in the graph. It turned on and off five times in the span of 1000ms or
      one second. For the second LED (purple), it only turns on and off once in the span of one second, splitting the time 
      in half. As for the last LED (blue), it is never off for the first second because it's delay of the program (keeping it 
      on) is exactly one second or 1000ms!
    </p>
  <br>
  <b style="font-size: larger;">2: How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would 
    that draw?</b>
    <p>
      For the first question, this would depend on how many individual pins there are on the Arduino. To do more than pin 
      available would be possible by adding more LEDs to the circuits, but that wouldn't be an independently run LED anymore. 
      Looking at the controller, I could blink 14 different LEDs in the 0-13 numbered pins that are programmable. 
      As for the current, each LED is its own circuit that should have no more than 20mA going through it. So if I were
      to use all 14 pins for 14 LEDs, all using 20mA or less, I would have about 20mA x 14 circuits = 280mA. Running all 
      14 pins, I should not exceed 280mA of current through the whole Arduino to keep it in a safe range. 
    </p>
  <br>
  <b>3: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?</b>
  <p>
    This was experimented on in my playing around. I had tested how much time in milliseconds had to be on and off to not
    notice a difference. I first tried 10 and then 15. I couldn't see a difference in 10, but I could in 15ms intervals. 
    However, I got confused and went up from 15 instead of down! I'm not sure how I got to that as the right way, but as I 
    got to blinks every 50ms, I realized I was noticing it more and more. After this, I tried the experiment again and started
    from 15ms and decreased the time. It was around 12 or 11ms where I couldn't tell the difference exactly!
